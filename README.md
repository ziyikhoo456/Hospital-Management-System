A Hospital Management System (HMS) is developed in Java using Eclipse IDE and object-oriented programming concepts. The main objective of the HMS is to manage activities in a hospital, including patient, doctor, administrative staff, medicine, facility, and laboratory. And thus, this HMS should contain tables for all records of the patient, doctor, 
administrative staff, medicine, facility, and laboratory.
